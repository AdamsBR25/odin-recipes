    <!-- Recipe Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <!-- Ingredient list content -->
        <li>3 Tablespoons cornstarch, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound flank steak, cut into thin 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 cups small broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced white onions</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Recipe Steps -->
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <!-- Step list content -->
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 3 tablespoons water. Add the beef to the bowl and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon cornstarch with the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic and ginger. Set the sauce aside. </li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick saut√© pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil and once it is hot, add the beef and cook, stirring constantly until the beef is almost cooked through. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the beef to a plate and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the pan and once it is hot, add the broccoli florets and sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until the broccoli is tender, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pan then add the prepared sauce. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until the sauce thickens slightly. Serve with rice or noodles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To guarantee bright green broccoli, blanch the florets in boiling water then drain and dry it very well before adding it to the pan. If you opt for this additional blanching step, reduce the cooking time of the broccoli to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>The sauce must come to a boil in order for the cornstarch to work as a thickening agent.</li>
    </ol>
